title DRPC Framework Workflow

actor "Client" as client
participant "Consumer\nApplication" as consumer
participant "RPC Test\nConsumer Handler" as consumerHandler
participant "RPC Encoder" as encoder
participant "Network" as network
participant "RPC Decoder" as decoder
participant "RPC Provider\nHandler" as providerHandler
participant "RPC Service\nScanner" as svcScanner
participant "Provider\nApplication" as provider
participant "RPC Single\nServer" as rpcServer

note right of client
  1. Client initiates RPC call
end note

client -> consumer : Start application
consumer -> consumerHandler : Channel becomes active
consumerHandler -> consumerHandler : Create RPC request\nwith RpcHeaderFactory
consumerHandler -> encoder : Serialize request\nwith JDK serialization
encoder -> network : Send encoded data
network -> decoder : Receive data
decoder -> decoder : Deserialize with\nJDK serialization
decoder -> providerHandler : Pass RpcProtocol<Request>
providerHandler -> providerHandler : Submit to ServerThreadPool
providerHandler -> providerHandler : Look up service\nin handlerMap
providerHandler -> providerHandler : Invoke method\nbased on reflectType\n(JDK or CGLIB)
providerHandler -> encoder : Serialize response\nwith JDK serialization
encoder -> network : Send response
network -> decoder : Receive response
decoder -> consumerHandler : Pass RpcProtocol<Response>
consumerHandler -> consumer : Process response

note left of rpcServer
  RpcSingleServer initializes
and scans for @RpcService
annotated classes using
RpcServiceScanner
Services registered in
handlerMap
end note

rpcServer -> svcScanner : Scan packages for\n@RpcService classes
svcScanner -> svcScanner : Create service instances\nand register in handlerMap

note right of provider
  Service implementations\nare annotated with\n@RpcService
end note

note right of providerHandler
  Supports multiple reflection types:\n- JDK Reflection\n- CGLIB Reflection\nFalls back to JDK if CGLIB fails
end note
